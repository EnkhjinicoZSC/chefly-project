# Capstone Project

This GitHub repo serves as a codebase for my final year capstone project, which is a web app platform for connecting chefs with customers. Users are able to find chefs based on their preferences with the help of a recommendation system and request chefs at a proposed time based on the availabilities of chefs. Chefs as users are able to accept or decline the request. 

Frameworks: Django and React

## To initialize:

```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**To run the app:** `python3 manage.py runserver`

And then the server is running up on the local host: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
